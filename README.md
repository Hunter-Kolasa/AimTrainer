# Welcome to Aim Trainer!

    This full-stack application uses a Rails API as its backend and combines JavaScript, HTML and CSS in its frontend.  With this app, a user is able to sign in/up with a username before beginning a game that tests your hand-eye coordination against a moving background.
    **** WARNING: May cause minor motion sickness. ****

# Setup

    To begin, navigate to the backend from the project directory, install any necessary gems and start the Rails server via:

        - cd backend
        - bundle install
        - rails s
    
    Then, open index.html from the frontend directory and begin!

# Instructions

    Click targets that appear at an increasing rate until you 1) miss a target 5 times or 2) allow 30 targets to populate the screen at any given time.  The ONLY way you can actually lose is by not hitting any targets. 

    Good luck and have fun! Thank you for using Aim Trainer!
